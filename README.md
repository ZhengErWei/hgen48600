Briefly, the R Markdown files are saved in `analysis/`, the data files are saved
in `data/`, shared scripts are saved in `code/`, and the website files are saved
in `docs/`. New R Markdown files can be created with the function
`wflow_open()`, the website can be built with `wflow_build()`, and the files and
